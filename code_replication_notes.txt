This file is for making notes on what problems/solutions people encounter when trying to run the paper's public code base.

To run code from codes_for_models/zeroshot/ the readme specifies you must install efficiency, which is an experimental framework for logging things.
I encountered an error when using the most up-to-date version, but version 1.0 seems to work.
Run pip install efficiency==1.0 to install.

# Progress
Since last progress report we began trying to run the author's code, although we ran into a number of problems when doing so. We also corresponded with the authors regarding a replication issue and obtaining fine-tuned models used in the paper. They responded that we should fine-tune a new set of models ourselves to replicate results and that the replication issue was not resolved. We also presented our first update in class. 

# Next Tasks

1. The most important task for us is to get the author's code running, particularly to produce the results for the electra models. Since the codebase is not well documented and the environment used is unclear and out of date, this may take a significant amount of work

2. Gain access and run code on remote machines. Eventually if we retrain models, we will need to use these computational resources. 

3. Figure out how to run the fine-tuning process for models which haven't been stored by the authors, this could involve more contact with the authors directly.

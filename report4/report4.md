# Progress


# Next Tasks

1. The most important task for us is to get the author's code running, particularly to produce the results for the electra models. Since the codebase is not well documented and the environment used is unclear and out of date, this may take a significant amount of work

2. Gain access and run code on remote machines. Eventually if we retrain models, we will need to use these computational resources. 

3. Figure out how to run the fine-tuning process for models which haven't been stored by the author's, this could involve contacting the authors directly.

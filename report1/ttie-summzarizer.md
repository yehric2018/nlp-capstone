## Summary
This research paper discusses the issue of text-to-image generative models favoring specific social groups when prompted with neutral text descriptions. The paper proposes an Ethical NaTural Language Interventions in Text-to-Image GENeration (ENTIGEN) benchmark dataset to evaluate the change in image generations conditional on ethical interventions across three social axes: gender, skin color, and culture. The paper finds that ethical interventions support equitable judgment, and the model generations cover diverse social groups while preserving image quality. In some cases, the generations would be anti-stereotypical. 

## MVP
Replicating this research paper would have to start with examining the paper and github code carefully as to understand exactly what approach was taken. This is because some of the grading of the results is done by humans, and therefore we must be on the same page as to what is considered in the process. Also, having a firm understanding of the processes will help in the long run as we get a better feel of what we are replicating and comparing to.

Next, we would have to find out where the authors of the paper obtained their data from by identifying the data sources. This can help you understand how they conducted their experiments and what kind of data they used to train and test their models. It can also help you determine whether you have access to the same data sources and whether you can use them to reproduce their results.

Once we have found the authorâ€™s sources, we would have to collect the same datasets and reproduce their research. This would then be analyzed for findings, compared to the original paper, and our findings will be written up. 

## Stretch Goals
Some stretch goals could be improving upon the analysis methods of the original paper, and using newer text-to-image generative models like DALL-E 2 or Midjourney

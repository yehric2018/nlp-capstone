# Report 2

## Pros/Cons

### ESGS Summarizer
- Pros
  - Will give a comprehensive dive into several aspects of NLP
  - Github code is publicly available (including the datasets on the repo)
  - Would be fun to see what kinds of summaries are generated
- Cons
  - Consists of four non-trivial components, might be a big undertaking to implement completely
  - Usefulness is a little questionable: Procedures are already written to be pretty concise, and it might not be desirable to only focus on a few of the entities in the procedure
  - Authors of the paper are from China, so it would be hard to reach out for help if needed
  - Codebase has minimal documentation, so difficult to understand what is going on code-wise

### K-means Translator

### Logical Fallacy Detection
Pros:
- Codebase with some of the saved models (particularly the ones that performed the best) and datasets
- Logical fallacy detection seems useful to the world, especially in the context of combating climate change misinformation (which the paper has a focus on)
- The NLP task described in the paper doesn’t seem extremely complicated/extremely difficult to understand.

Cons:
- Codebase doesn’t have all of the saved models
  - Some of the models not saved are large language models that may be difficult to access/finetune
  - Some of the current stretch goals involve models such as GPT-4 that also may be difficult to access/finetune
-	Codebase not super-well-documented (there’s a little bit of documentation)

### Entigen Summarizer
Pros: 
- Authors made reproducabiity easy, and all resources are free and public
- socially important research, with real-world benefits. 
- easily implementable stretch goals
- existing public repository

Cons:
- might not be enough work
- repo lacking in comments and development documentation
- reliant on human visual analysis

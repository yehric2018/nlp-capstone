# Report 2

## Pros/Cons

### ESGS Summarizer
- Pros
  - Will give a comprehensive dive into several aspects of NLP
  - Github code is publicly available (including the datasets on the repo)
  - Would be fun to see what kinds of summaries are generated
- Cons
  - Consists of four non-trivial components, might be a big undertaking to implement completely
  - Usefulness is a little questionable: Procedures are already written to be pretty concise, and it might not be desirable to only focus on a few of the entities in the procedure
